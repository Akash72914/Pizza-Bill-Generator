👨‍💻 Just finished building a Pizza Billing System in Java! 🍕

This project helped me understand the core principles of:
✅ Object-Oriented Programming
✅ Inheritance & Method Overriding
✅ Clean User Input Handling with Scanner
✅ Real-world simulation using classes like Pizza and DeluxPizza

Users can choose between Veg, Non-Veg, and Deluxe pizzas with customizable toppings, cheese, and takeaway options — and get a full bill generated instantly!

Built with pure Java (no frameworks) using OOP design to make the code easily extendable and clean.

Would love to hear your feedback or suggestions. 😄
